MCLs are set as close to the MCLGs as feasible using the best available treatment technology.\nMaximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG): The \u201cGoal\u201d (MCLG) is the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health.  MCLGs allow for a margin of safety.\nTotal Coliform Rule (TCR): This is the regulation that pertains to disinfectant and bacteriological monitoring.\n\n\nSource Water Assessment\n\n\nThe North Shore Water Commission purifies water from Lake Michigan. The latest evaluation by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) indicates our source water quality is susceptible to pollution and contaminants. Preserving the water quality of Lake Michigan is essential to maintaining your drinking water quality. For more information on the impacts to your source of drinking water, see the Source Water Assessment for North Shore Water Commission at http://northshorewater.org/images/materials/SWA-2002.pdf.\n\n\nEducation Information\n\n\nThe sources of drinking water, both tap water and bottled water, include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity. Contaminants that may be present in source water include:\n\n\nMicrobial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations and wildlife.\n\n\nInorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally-occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining or farming.\n\n\nPesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff and residential uses.\n\n\nOrganic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff and septic systems.\n\n\nRadioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.\n\n\nIn order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. Food and Drug Administration regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water, which should provide the same protection for public health.\n\n\nHealth Information\n\n\nDrinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s safe drinking water hotline (800-426-4791).\nSome people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune systems disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s safe drinking water hotline (800-426-4791).\n\n\n-- Lead Information --\n\n\nIf present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. North Shore Water Commission is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 3 minutes before using water for drinking or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.\n\n\nStaff\n\n\nEric Kiefer has been the Plant Manager since 2007. He received a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in chemistry from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh as well as a Master of Business Administration degree from Marquette University. All full-time staff that participate in operations, including Mr. Kiefer, have a WDNR Municipal Waterworks Operator Certification.\n\n\nTurbidity Monitoring\n\n\nIn accordance with s. NR 810.29, Wisconsin Administrative Code, the treated surface water is monitored for turbidity to confirm that the filtered water is less than 0.30 NTU. Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of water. We monitor for it because it is a good indicator of the effectiveness of our filtration system. During the year, the highest single entry point turbidity measurement was 0.09 NTU. The lowest monthly percentage of samples meeting the turbidity limits was 100 percent.\n\n\nUnregulated Contaminants Monitoring Rule (UCMR3)\n\n\nEPA periodically requires water systems to test for unregulated contaminants to better understand their occurrence in drinking water. These compounds are not regulated, and therefore, have no additional reporting and/or treatment requirements. Glendale was selected by EPA to conduct this testing in 2013 and Whitefish Bay was selected to do the same from the summer of 2014 to 2015\n\n\nThe following compounds were tested under UCMR3: 1,2,3-trichloropropane, chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), vanadium, chromium, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), bromomethane, 1,3-butadiene, molybdenum, chromium-6, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), chloromethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, cobalt, chlorate, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), bromochloromethane (Halon 1011), 1,4-dioxane, strontium, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA).\n\n\nCurrent Officials*\n\n\nFox Point:  Michael West, Member\n        (414) 352-2712\n        Scott Botcher, Alternate\n        (414) 351-8900; sbotcher@villageoffoxpoint.com\n        Kelly Meyer, Fiscal Agent\n        (414) 351-8900; kmeyer@villageoffoxpoint.com \nGlendale:   Dave Eastman, Chair \n        (414) 228-1746; d.eastman@glendale-wi.org \n        Richard Maslowski, Alternate\n        (414) 228-1705\nWhitefish Bay:  John Edlebeck, Secretary\n        (414) 962-6690; j.edlebeck@wfbvillage.org\n        Paul Boening, Member\n        (414) 962-6690; p.boening@wfbvillage.org\nManagement: Eric Kiefer, Plant Manager\n        (414) 963-0160; info@northshorewc.com\n\n\n*Officers from the member communities rotate positions annually at the May meeting.",

As a prerequisite, operators need to understand the following math concepts which will be discussed in this module:\n\n\n\n\naddition  \n\n\nsubtraction  \n\n\nmultiplication  \n\n\ndivision  \n\n\n\n\nOperators also need to understand the following concepts:\n\n\n\n\nfractions  \n\n\nstatistics  \n\n\nunit analysis  \n\n\nconversion between fractions and decimal equivalent  \n\n\nrounding  \n\n\narea  \n\n\nvolume  \n\n\nrates\n\n\n\n\nFractions\n\n\nThere are many cases when operators need to work with fractions. For instance, when dealing with flow rates, operators need to remember that a flow rate such as 3.0 million gallons per day (MGD) can be written as a fraction:  \n\n\n\n\n3.0 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\nThis is useful to know if you are trying to add flow rates when units are not equivalent. For example, let's say you want to add 300 gallons per minute (GPM) to 3.0 MGD.  \n\n\n\n\n300 \\frac {Gallons}{Minute} + 3.0 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\nAs it is written, you cannot add these 2 fractions until you convert the units so that the units are the same. We'll come back to solving this at the very \nend of the module\n.  \n\n\nAdding and Subtracting\n\n\nWhen the units are the same, you can proceed with basic math operations. Let's assume you are able to get the units the same, now what? Consider the following expression:\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, you cannot proceed until you get convert the fraction(s) so that the denominator is the same. In case you are not familiar with the term \"denominator,\" see the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {numerator}{denominator}\n\n\n\n\nGetting back to our simple example, here is how you would proceed. \n\n\n\n\nMultiply the numerator and denominator of one of the fractions by the same amount to get an equivalent fraction--so that the equivalent fraction has the same denominator as the other fraction.\n\n\nAdd the numerators together.\n\n\nNote: do NOT add the demoninators!\n\n\n\n\nIn this case:\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {1}{2} \\times \\left(\\frac {2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{4}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {2}{4} + \\frac {1}{4} = \\frac {3}{4}\n\n\n\n\nMultiplying and Dividing\n\n\nWhen multiplying and dividing, you proceed in the following manner:  \n\n\n\n\n\\frac {a}{b} \\times \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac {a \\times c}{b \\times d}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {a}{b} \\div \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac {a}{b} \\times \\frac{d}{c} = \\frac {a \\times d}{b \\times c}\n\n\n\n\nUsing numbers instead of variable, consider the following expression:\n\n\n\n\n\\frac {2}{3} \\times \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac {2 \\times 4}{3 \\times 7} = \\frac {8}{21}\n\n\n\n\nMore Information\n\n\nFor more information, visit this \nKhan Academy website.\n\n\nStatistics\n\n\nStatistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In applying statistics to operations, we first need to select the applicable data and the select the statistical model.\n\n\nIn most cases, we select all of the measurements (i.e. chlorine residual) taken over the course of the day and run the basic analyses:\n\n\n\n\nAverage (mean)  \n\n\nMax  \n\n\nMin  \n\n\nRange  \n\n\n\n\nAverage\n\n\nTo determine the average, add up all of the values to determine the sum. Divide the sum of values by the number of samples to get the average.\n\n\nFor instance, let's say you have the following chlorine residuals.\n\n\n\n\n(2.1, 2.5, 2.3, 2.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSum\\,of\\,Values = 2.1 + 2.5 + 2.3 + 2.7 = 9.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber\\,of\\,Samples = 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage = \\frac {Sum\\,of\\,Values}{Number\\,of\\,Samples} = \\frac {9.6}{4} = 2.4\n\n\n\n\nMax\n\n\nThe max is the greatest value in a collection of measurements.\n\n\n\n\nMax = 2.7\n\n\n\n\nMin\n\n\nThe min is the smallest value in a collection of measurements.\n\n\n\n\nMin = 2.1\n\n\n\n\nRange\n\n\nRange is the difference between the max and the min.\n\n\nUse the numbers in this section:\n\n\n\n\nRange = Max - Min = 2.7 - 2.1 = 0.6\n\n\n\n\nUnit Analysis\n\n\nIt is important to understand units and how they apply to measurements and observations. For instance, a measurement of 2.3 ppm of free chlorine residual can be expressed as the following:\n\n\n\n\n2.3 \\frac {part}{million\\,parts}\n\n\n\n\nor equivalently:\n\n\n\n\n2.3 \\frac {milligrams}{liter}\n\n\n\n\nNote: one \"part\" is a milligram. There are 1000 milligrams (mg) in a gram. Water weighs 1 gram (g) per milliliter. There are a thousand milliliters (mL) in a liter (L). Look at the following derivation.\n\n\n\n\n\\require{cancel}\n\n\n\\frac{mg}{L} = \\frac{mg}{\\cancel L} \\times \\frac{\\cancel L}{1000 \\cancel {mL}} \\times \\frac{\\cancel {ml}}{\\cancel g} \\times \\frac{\\cancel g}{1000 mg}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\frac{mg}{L} = \\frac {mg}{1000 \\times 1000\\,mg} = \\frac{mg}{1,000,000 mg} = \\frac {part}{million\\,parts}\n\n\n\n\nNote: This assumes that 1 mL equals 1 g. This is true for pure water. You can make this assumption for any chemical... just note that as you get closer to a pure chemical, this assumption fails.\n  \n\n\nUnit analysis is important when you need to convert units. For example, if you a pump running at 1000 gallons per minute (GPM), you need unit analysis to convert GPM to MGD.  \n\n\nConversion Between Fractions and Decimal Equivalent\n\n\nEvery fraction can be expressed as a decimal, and vice versa. For example, take the number 0.125.\n\n\n\n\n0.125 = \\frac{125}{1000} = \\frac{1}{8}\n\n\n\nand take the fraction \n5/16\n:\n\n\n\\frac {5}{16} = 0.3125\n\n\n\n\nRounding\n\n\nNumbers in base 10 (the numbers we are used to using) are composed of digits that represent different values of 10. Look at the following number: \n\n\n\n\n124.17\n\n\n\\underline{hundreds}\\,\\underline{tens}\\,\\underline{ones}\\,. \\underline {tenths}\\,\\underline {hundredths}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you round to the nearest tenth, the answer is \n124.2\n.  \n\n\nIf you round to the nearest ten, the answer is \n120\n.  \n\n\nIf you round to the nearest hundred, the answer is \n100\n.  \n\n\n\n\nAfter you identify what digit you are rounding to, you look at the next digit (to the right) and determine if that number is 5 or more. If the answer is yes, then you increase the digit you are rounding to by one... and you drop all of the digits to the right. If NOT, then you don't change that digit and you drop all of the digits to the right.\n\n\nArea\n\n\nArea allows us to better describe and measure 2 dimensional shapes. For instance, the area of a rectangle is the length multiplied by width. If this rectangle represents a wall, knowing the area could tell us how much paint is required to cover it.   \n\n\nClick here for more information about area.\n.  \n\n\nVolume\n\n\nVolume allows us to better describe and measure properties of 3 dimensional shapes. Volume is very relevant to the treatment process; we are constantly monitoring the volume of various liquids that are stored in our tanks.\n\n\nIn most cases, we would need to measure volume if we needed to determine how many gallons of water will fit in a rectangular chamber. In this case:\n\n\n\n\nVolume=Length \\times Width \\times Height\n\n\n\n\nTo convert from volume in cubic feet to gallons, use the following conversion:\n\n\n\n\n7.48\\,gallons = 1\\,cubic\\,foot\n\n\n\n\nFinal Words\n\n\nLet's go back to this problem:\n\n\n\n\n300 \\frac {Gallons}{Minute} + 3.0 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to get the units to match up.\n\n\n\n\n300 \\frac {\\cancel {Gallons}}{\\cancel {Minute}} \\times \\frac {1 Million\\,Gallons}{1,000,000 \\cancel {Gallons}} \\times \\frac {1,440 \\cancel {Minutes}}{Day} =\n\n\n0.432 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\nThen the fractions need to be added.\n\n\n\n\n0.432 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day} + 3.0 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day} =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.432 \\frac {Million\\,Gallons}{Day}\n\n\n\n\n*Note: In Operator Chemistry we discuss significant digits. This number should be reported as 3.4 MGD if we take significant digits into consideration.",

This section discusses some of the most important topics an operator must know.\n\n\n\n\nAcids & Bases  \n\n\nConcentration & Dillution  \n\n\nPeriodic Table of Elements  \n\n\nDensity   \n\n\nTitration    \n\n\nGlassware, Equipment, and Analytical Equipment  \n\n\nWorking with Numbers  \n\n\n\n\nAcids & Bases\n\n\nAcids and bases are used in our treatment process. It is important to understand the basic properties of these chemicals so that you can safely handle them and predict how they will react with other chemicals.\n\n\nAcids have a pH below 7. Bases have a pH above 7. Typically, most chemicals or solutions will have a pH within the range of 0 to 14.\n\n\\require{mhchem}\n\n\n\n\nBefore we can discuss the meaning of pH, you must first understand some chemical properties of water (\n\\ce{H2O}\n). One of them is that water is in equilibrium with hydronium and hydroxyl ions depicted in the reaction shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\\ce{H2O_{(l)} \\rightleftharpoons H^+_{(aq)} + OH^{-}_{(aq)}}\n\n\n\n\nNote: \nH^+\n is shorthand for \n\\ce{H3O^+}\n. The proton ion \nH^+\n associates with water molecule.\n\n\nWater (on the left) is in equilibrium with \nH^+\n (hydronium) and \nOH^-\n (hydroxyl) ions. This means that water is dynamic; it is constantly converting between water and its parts. Other chemicals behave in the same manner.\n\n\nYou can measure how many \nH^+\n are in solution. This is typically done with several electrodes. In the probe shown in the image below, there is both a reference electrode and a pH electrode. The pH electrode has a glass bulb and is inserted into the solution that needs to be measured. The reference electrode is inside the body of the probe.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you insert the pH probe into a solution, an electrial potential will develop across the pH electrode (outside electrode vs inside electrode). The more \nH^+\n ions in solution, the greater the potential. When you compare this potential to the potential of the reference electrode, you can determine how many \nH^+\n ions are in solution. As it turns out, the relationship between potential and pH is -59.18 mV/pH.\n\n\nSo, what exactly is pH? \n\n\nWhen you measure pH, you are measuring the concentration of \nH^+\n ions. However, there are a wide range of \nH^+\n ions that are typically observed. Instead of reporting a value of 0.0000007 moles / L or 0.1 moles / L of hydronium ions, is more convient to use the log of concentration.\n\n\n\n\npH = -log\\ce{[H^{+}]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npH\n\n\n\n\n\\ce{[H^{+}]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.0001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n0.00001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n0.000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n0.0000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.00000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n0.000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.0000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.00000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.000000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.0000000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.00000000000001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreasing the pH by 1, decreases the concentration of hydronium ions by a factor of 10.   \n\n\nFor more information about what \"log\" means, visit the \nKahn Academy website\n.\n\n\nFor more information about acids, bases, and pH, visit the following \nKahn Academy video\n. There are a number of videos in this series.\n\n\nConcentration & Dillution\n\n\nOften, chemicals are purchased in a concentrated form. A solution of a weaker concentration is made by mixing a concentrated chemical with water (or another chemical).\n\n\nThe equation which is often very helfpul to us is:\n\n\n\n\nv_1c_1=v_2c_2\n\n\n\n\nwhere \nv_1\n is volume of the undilluted chemical, \nc_1\n is the concentration of undilluted chemical, \nv_2\n is the volume of the dilluted chemical, and \nc_2\n is the concentration of the dilluted chemical.\n\n\nLet's say we want to make 100 mL of 5% hydrochloric acid using concentrated hydrochloric acid that has a strength of 37%.\n\n\nIn this case, we need to solve for \nv_2\n.\n\n\n\n\nv_1=\\frac{v_2c_2}{c_1}=\\frac{100 mL \\times 5\\%}{37\\%}=14mL\n\n\n\n\nSo 14 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid should be dilluted to 100 mL using water (86 mL of water) to make 100 mL of 5% hydrochloric. \n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nNever add water to concentrated acid. The solution can heat up too fast and splash out of vessel. Always add concentrated acid to water.\n\n\n\n\nPeriodic Table of Elements\n\n\nEverything in the universe is made out of atoms. Atoms exhibit specific properties based on how many electrons, protons, and neutrons are in the atom. Specifically, the number of protons in an atom determines what element it is. For example, an atom with 12 protrons is called magnesium. In other words, an atom is a single particle of an element.\n\n\nAll of the known elements are typically presented in what is called a periodic table of elements.\n\n\nVisit this link to see an interactive periodic table.\n\n\nEverything in the known universe is made out of these elements, including everyday chemicals. Elements are a special type of chemical; they consist of just one type of atoms.\n\n\nCompounds are a mixture of atoms that are bonded together at the atomic level. One example is table salt; it is made out of sodium (\nNa\n) and chorine (\nCl\n) atoms. Table salt has unique properties--it does not exhibit properties of chlrine nor does it exhibit the properties of sodium.\n\n\nHint: you can use the periodic table to read chemical formulas. For instance, the chemical formula for water is \n\\ce{H_2O}\n; one molecule is made out of 2 hydrogen atoms (\nH\n) and 1 oxygen (\nO\n) atom.\n\n\nDensity\n\n\nDensity is a property of a chemical that describes how much mass is contained in a unit of volume. For instance, the density of water is 1 gram per 1 mL of water. Alternatively, the density of water can be expressed as 8.34 lbs per gallon (approximately true around at \"normal\" water temperatures).\n\n\nThe denser the material, the \"heavier\" it is. Consequently, denser materials sink to the bottom and less dense materials float to the top. This is why ice forms on top of a lake instead of sinking to the bottom; ice is less dense than water.\n\n\nSometimes, density is expressed as \"specific gravity\". This a ratio of densities: the density of a chemical compared to the density of pure water. For example, if the specific gravity of a chemical is 1.2, this means it has a density of \n1.2 \\times 8.34 \\frac {lbs}{gal}= 10 \\frac {lbs}{gals}\n.\n\n\nTitration\n\n\nGlassware, Equipment, and Analytical Equipment\n\n\nWorking with Numbers\n\n\nPrecision and accuracy are important concepts in chemistry. You need to be careful when you work with numbers of different precisions.  \n\n\nFor instances, let's say you want to add a very precise number (i.e. 2004.214 g) to a number of low precision (i.e. 2000 g). How do you report the sum? \n\n\nBefore we can answer that, you need to understand significant digits.\n\n\nSignificant Digits\n\n\nThere are three rules on determining how many significant figures are in a number:\n\n\n\n\nNon-zero digits are always significant.  \n\n\nAny zeros between two significant digits are significant.  \n\n\nA final zero or trailing zeros in the decimal portion ONLY are significant.\n\n\n\n\nPlease remember that, in science, all numbers are based upon measurements (except for a very few that are defined). Since all measurements are uncertain, we must only use those numbers that are meaningful.  A common ruler cannot measure something to be 22.4072643 cm long. Not all of the digits have meaning (significance) and, therefore, should not be written down. In science, only the numbers that have significance (derived from measurement) are written.\n\n\nAdding and Subtracting\n\n\nFor addition and subtraction, look at the decimal portion (i.e., to the right of the decimal point) of the numbers ONLY. Here is what to do:\n\n\n1) Count the number of significant figures in the decimal portion of each number in the problem. (The digits to the left of the decimal place are not used to determine the number of decimal places in the final answer.)\n\n\n2) Add or subtract in the normal fashion.\n\n\n3) Round the answer to the LEAST number of places in the decimal portion of any number in the problem. \n\n\nExample: What is the sum of 2.25 and 0.025?\n\n\nWhile it is true the sum is 2.275, the value should reflect the reliability of the least precise operation. The answer should be reported as 2.28. \n\n\nMultiplying and Dividing\n\n\nIn mathematical operations involving significant figures, the answer is reported in such a way that it reflects the reliability of the least precise operation. Let's state that another way: a chain is no stronger than its weakest link. An answer is no more precise that the least precise number used to get the answer. Let's do it one more time: imagine a team race where you and your team must finish together. Who dictates the speed of the team? Of course, the slowest member of the team. Your answer cannot be MORE precise than the least precise measurement.  \n\n\nThe following rule applies for multiplication and division:\n\n\nThe LEAST number of significant figures in any number of the problem determines the number of significant figures in the answer.\n\n\nThis means you MUST know how to recognize significant figures in order to use this rule.\n\nExample #1: 2.5 x 3.42.\n\n\nThe answer to this problem would be 8.6 (which was rounded from the calculator reading of 8.55). Why?\n\n\n2.5 has two significant figures while 3.42 has three. Two significant figures is less precise than three, so the answer has two significant figures.",

Here is what to do:  1) Count the number of significant figures in the decimal portion of each number in the problem. (The digits to the left of the decimal place are not used to determine the number of decimal places in the final answer.)  2) Add or subtract in the normal fashion.  3) Round the answer to the LEAST number of places in the decimal portion of any number in the problem.   Example: What is the sum of 2.25 and 0.025?  While it is true the sum is 2.275, the value should reflect the reliability of the least precise operation. The answer should be reported as 2.28.",

            "text": "In mathematical operations involving significant figures, the answer is reported in such a way that it reflects the reliability of the least precise operation. Let's state that another way: a chain is no stronger than its weakest link. An answer is no more precise that the least precise number used to get the answer. Let's do it one more time: imagine a team race where you and your team must finish together. Who dictates the speed of the team? Of course, the slowest member of the team. Your answer cannot be MORE precise than the least precise measurement.    The following rule applies for multiplication and division:  The LEAST number of significant figures in any number of the problem determines the number of significant figures in the answer.  This means you MUST know how to recognize significant figures in order to use this rule. \nExample #1: 2.5 x 3.42.  The answer to this problem would be 8.6 (which was rounded from the calculator reading of 8.55). Why?  2.5 has two significant figures while 3.42 has three. Two significant figures is less precise than three, so the answer has two significant figures.",
