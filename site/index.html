<h1 id="source-water-assessment">Source Water Assessment</h1>
<p>The North Shore Water Commission purifies water from Lake Michigan. The latest evaluation by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) indicates our source water quality is susceptible to pollution and contaminants. Preserving the water quality of Lake Michigan is essential to maintaining your drinking water quality. For more information on the impacts to your source of drinking water, see the Source Water Assessment for North Shore Water Commission at http://northshorewater.org/images/materials/SWA-2002.pdf.</p>
<h1 id="education-information">Education Information</h1>
<p>The sources of drinking water, both tap water and bottled water, include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material, and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity. Contaminants that may be present in source water include:</p>
<h2 id="microbial-contaminants-such-as-viruses-and-bacteria-which-may-come-from-sewage-treatment-plants-septic-systems-agricultural-livestock-operations-and-wildlife">Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems, agricultural livestock operations and wildlife.</h2>
<h2 id="inorganic-contaminants-such-as-salts-and-metals-which-can-be-naturally-occurring-or-result-from-urban-stormwater-runoff-industrial-or-domestic-wastewater-discharges-oil-and-gas-production-mining-or-farming">Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals, which can be naturally-occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff, industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining or farming.</h2>
<h2 id="pesticides-and-herbicides-which-may-come-from-a-variety-of-sources-such-as-agriculture-urban-stormwater-runoff-and-residential-uses">Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a variety of sources such as agriculture, urban stormwater runoff and residential uses.</h2>
<h2 id="organic-chemical-contaminants-including-synthetic-and-volatile-organic-chemicals-which-are-by-products-of-industrial-processes-and-petroleum-production-and-can-also-come-from-gas-stations-urban-stormwater-runoff-and-septic-systems">Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic and volatile organic chemicals, which are by-products of industrial processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban stormwater runoff and septic systems.</h2>
<h2 id="radioactive-contaminants-which-can-be-naturally-occurring-or-be-the-result-of-oil-and-gas-production-and-mining-activities">Radioactive contaminants, which can be naturally occurring or be the result of oil and gas production and mining activities.</h2>
<p>In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, EPA prescribes regulations that limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. Food and Drug Administration regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water, which should provide the same protection for public health.</p>
<h1 id="health-information">Health Information</h1>
<p>Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water hotline (800-426-4791).
Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune systems disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Environmental Protection Agency’s safe drinking water hotline (800-426-4791).</p>
<p>-- Lead Information --</p>
<p>If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. North Shore Water Commission is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 3 minutes before using water for drinking or cooking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water, testing methods, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline or at www.epa.gov/safewater/lead.</p>
<h1 id="staff">Staff</h1>
<p>Eric Kiefer has been the Plant Manager since 2007. He received a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in chemistry from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh as well as a Master of Business Administration degree from Marquette University. All full-time staff that participate in operations, including Mr. Kiefer, have a WDNR Municipal Waterworks Operator Certification.</p>
<h1 id="turbidity-monitoring">Turbidity Monitoring</h1>
<p>In accordance with s. NR 810.29, Wisconsin Administrative Code, the treated surface water is monitored for turbidity to confirm that the filtered water is less than 0.30 NTU. Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of water. We monitor for it because it is a good indicator of the effectiveness of our filtration system. During the year, the highest single entry point turbidity measurement was 0.09 NTU. The lowest monthly percentage of samples meeting the turbidity limits was 100 percent.</p>
<h1 id="unregulated-contaminants-monitoring-rule-ucmr3">Unregulated Contaminants Monitoring Rule (UCMR3)</h1>
<p>EPA periodically requires water systems to test for unregulated contaminants to better understand their occurrence in drinking water. These compounds are not regulated, and therefore, have no additional reporting and/or treatment requirements. Glendale was selected by EPA to conduct this testing in 2013 and Whitefish Bay was selected to do the same from the summer of 2014 to 2015</p>
<p>The following compounds were tested under UCMR3: 1,2,3-trichloropropane, chlorodifluoromethane (HCFC-22), vanadium, chromium, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), bromomethane, 1,3-butadiene, molybdenum, chromium-6, perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), chloromethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, cobalt, chlorate, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), bromochloromethane (Halon 1011), 1,4-dioxane, strontium, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA).</p>
