# Background

The North Shore Water Commission was established in November of 1957. Its purpose is to supply water to its members:

* Village of Fox Point
* City of Glendale
* Village of Whitefish Bay

Prior to the Commission, each member received water from the City of Milwaukee. Our members felt that the City of Milwaukee was charging subburbs too much for water, so they decided to build their own treatment plant -- the one the NSWC now operates and maintains.
